ðŸ§  Mnemonic Generator Scraper

This project scrapes mnemonic content from the Mammoth Memory website using Selenium and BeautifulSoup to create a structured dataset for training a multilingual and multimodal mnemonic generation model.

ðŸ“Œ What This Script Does
	â€¢	Takes in a URL from the Mammoth Memory website.
	â€¢	Extracts the following:
	â€¢	âœ… Words/concept pairs (e.g., chemical element + symbol)
	â€¢	âœ… Associated mnemonic text
	â€¢	âœ… Highlighted red text (often used to emphasize keywords)
	â€¢	âœ… Image URLs used in visual mnemonics
	â€¢	âœ… Captions related to images (included in the dataset)

The extracted content is saved in a structured JSON format (result.json), ready for use in downstream training or analysis.

ðŸ§ª Technologies Used
	â€¢	Selenium (with headless Chrome) â€“ for dynamic webpage interaction and rendering
	â€¢	BeautifulSoup â€“ for HTML parsing and data extraction
	â€¢	re (Regex) â€“ for HTML cleanup and string processing
	â€¢	json â€“ for data output
