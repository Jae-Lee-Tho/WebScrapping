# 🧠 Mnemonic Generator Scraper

This project scrapes mnemonic content from the Mammoth Memory website using Selenium and BeautifulSoup to create a structured dataset for training a multilingual and multimodal mnemonic generation model.

## 📌 What This Script Does

Takes in a URL from the Mammoth Memory website and extracts the following:

- ✅ **Words/concept pairs** (e.g., chemical element + symbol)  
- ✅ **Associated mnemonic text**  
- ✅ **Highlighted red text** (often used to emphasize keywords)  
- ✅ **Image URLs** used in visual mnemonics  
- ✅ **Captions** related to images (included in the dataset)

The extracted content is saved in a structured JSON format (`result.json`), ready for use in downstream training or analysis.

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- 🧪 **Selenium** (with headless Chrome) – for dynamic webpage interaction and rendering  
- 🧪 **BeautifulSoup** – for HTML parsing and data extraction  
- 🧪 **re** (Regex) – for HTML cleanup and string processing  
- 🧪 **json** – for data output
